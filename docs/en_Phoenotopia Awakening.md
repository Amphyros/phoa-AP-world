# What's a Phoenixtopia?
Phoenotopia: Awakening a Platformer Adventure videogame you missed out on because you were busy playing games with a marketing budget.

# What does randomization do to this game?
Items get shuffled between the different locations in the game. These locations include key item locations, chests, gifts from NPCs, enemy and even lizard drops if you want those to be included. So each playthrough is unique.

# Should I play the vanilla game before I play the randomizer?
Probably yea

# WHY IS LOCATION X NOT RANDOMIZED??? I'LL SUE YOU!
I made this as a proof of concept which I can expand upon.
**Sunflower Road, the cave leading to the East bridge and anything beyond that are not included in the mod YET**.
Currently, only the first section of the game is included. Obtaining the Strange Urn past the Century Toad is considered the goal.

# Can I randomize the Wooden Bat as well?
Not yet, as the randomizer logic is currently very basic. I definitely will implement this later.

# What other adjustments have been made to the Base Game?
* Some cutscenes have been removed or changed.
* Bart's head is included in the randomizer pool. So story progression is pretty much disabled

# When will Star Illiad release?
I'll tell you when you finish a run of this randomizer and tell me about any issues you might have encountered.
